# Crafting Rules
In order to craft things you must have both the needed materials, the recipe/schematic/etc., proficiency in the tools for crafting such an item and possibly access to a needed location. Once you have acquired all of those things a tools check will need to be made with a DC based on the item being crafted. The amount of time it takes to make a thing depends on the thing.

Schematics and such can be found in shops, possibly out in the wild, and maybe from other crafters. Non magical items don't require dedicated schematics as if you are proficient in the needed tools that means you have just memorized all those basic things. 

You could possibly make your schematics/etc. by studying items.

Materials can be found in shops, mines, in the wilds, as quest rewards, and such like that. Different checks may be required to obtain schematics. Nature for herbs, athletics for mining, and beyond. 

# Sacrifice for Spells
If you are a full caster and all of you spell slots have been used up you can spend HP equal to 5 times the spell level to cast another spell. This can kill you. The spell cast must be of a level that you have spell slots for.

Depending on the level of the spell you also take a level of exhaustion. 

| Spell Level | Exhaustion Level |
|-------------|------------------|
| 1-3         | 1                |
| 4-6         | 2                |
| 7-8         | 3                |
| 9           | 4                |

# Exhausted
This version of exhaustion is pulled from the rules for the new version of DnD
EXHAUSTED [CONDITION]

While Exhausted (known in older books as Exhaustion), you experience the following effects:

Levels of Exhaustion. This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 10.

d20 Rolls Affected. When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.

Spell Save DCs Affected. Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.

Ending the Condition. Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer Exhausted. 

# Healing Potions
If you spend a full action to drink a healing potion you get the max HP that potion can provide. If you take it as a bonus action you roll as normal for the potion consumed. 

# Help Action:
You must have proficiency or expertise in the skill you are using to help in order to offer help. 

# Flanking
If you and an enemy of your enemy are flanking your target you gain expertise with that attack. 

# Players Suggest Inspiration
Players can nominate another to receive inspiration. The GM still has the final say but should probably listen to the players. 

# Extra Feats
Players can take an extra feat during level up when that level up increases their proficiency bonus. 

# Spell Casting
Leveled spells with a casting time of one bonus action and leveled spells with a casting time of 1 action can be cast on the same turn. 

# Ready Action
The trigger for a readied action must be fairly specific. Its hard to give a hard and fast ruling on this one and it kinda has to be case by case. 

If a player readies an attack action then can use all of their attacks if they have the extra attack feature. 

# Skills can be linked to different abilities
While not technically homebrew this is an optional rule in the DMG I run with. The following is straight out of the DMG

As described in the Player’s Handbook, a skill proficiency represents a character’s focus on one aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character’s Dexterity score describes, the character might be particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in proficiency in the skill. When that skill is used for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity.

Under certain circumstances, you can decide a character’s proficiency in a skill can be applied to a different ability check. For example, you might decide that a character forced to swim from an island to the mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the character’s proficiency bonus to apply to this ability check. In effect, you’re asking for a Constitution (Athletics) check, instead of a Strength (Athletics) check.

Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide a good justification for why a character’s training and aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead and allow it, rewarding the player’s creative thinking 
No longer copied from the DMG. Another example of this is a character with high strength using that stregnth for intimidation.

# Resurrection
It is a ritual spell that everyone has access to but is typically conducted by someone trained in the related practices. 
Casting Time: 1 Hour
Range/Area: Touch
Components: Verbal, Somatic, and a diamond worth 500GP

The primary caster begins conducting the ritual. At this time up to 4 individuals (including the primary caster) can choose to participate in the ritual. Participation involves doing things such as:
    
Presenting an item of sentimental value to both the target and participant and telling the story of why
Recounting a particular story of importance to both parties.
A cry out to a relevant deity for aid.
These suggestion are merely guidelines. Anything you can come up that you think would help is likely viable. 

After a participant completes their action the GM will provide them a relevant roll to make. Each participant makes their own roll. The DC for this roll will vary based upon the chosen participation method and how effective the GM determines it to be. Typically it will be around 15. 

Once the rolls are complete a final roll is made by the primary caster. This roll is a flat d20 check. The DC for this roll starts at 10. It increases by 1 for each successful resurrection the character being resurrected has undergone. The DC is decreased by 2 for every successful participation and by 3 for a critical success. The DC is increased by 2 on a failure and 3 on a critical failure. On a success of the flat check if the soul is willing it returns to the body. On a failure the soul moves onto the afterlife and is unable to be resurrected by this ritual spell. 

The True Resurrection or Wish spells can bypass this challenge. They can also restore a soul that was lost due to this ritual. 

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes 4 levels of exhaustion upon resurrection. 

You can only use inspiration for yourself during this ritual.

# Additional Martial Options
Barbarians, Fighters, and Rogues gain the Martial Adept feat for free when you take the 1st level in that class. 

# Sleep Spell
If cast at at 3rd Spell Rank or higher it becomes at Constitution Saving throw for the target based on your spell save DC. At 1st or 2nd rank it functions as RAW.
